    Introducing Reductive Dehalogenase DB Version 1.0
  </h3>
  <p id = "abouttext">
    The GWAS-ROCS Database is a freely available electronic database containing
    the largest and most comprehensive set of SNP-derived AUROCs. All of the
    data is either directly from, or derived from, GWAS Central â€” an open-access
     online repository of summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS)
     data. The database currently houses 569 simulated populations
     (corresponding to 219 different conditions) and SNP data (odds ratio, risk
     allele frequency, and p-values) for 2809 unique SNPs. Each study simulation
      record (GR-Card) contains study information web-scraped from GWAS Central
       and simulated population data (e.g. ROC curves, AUROCs, SNP-heritability
        scores) determined from careful population modelling to recreate
         individual-level GWAS data. All GWAS-ROCS data is downloadable and is
          intended for applications in genomics, biomarker discovery, and
           general education.
