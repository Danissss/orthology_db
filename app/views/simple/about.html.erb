    The GWAS-ROCS Database is a freely available electronic database containing the largest
    and most comprehensive set of SNP-derived AUROCs. All of the data is either directly from,
     or derived from, GWAS Central â€” an open-access online repository of summary-level genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) data. The database currently houses 569 simulated populations
       (corresponding to 219 different conditions) and SNP data (odds ratio, risk allele frequency,
        and p-values) for 2809 unique SNPs. Each study simulation record (GR-Card) contains study
         information web-scraped from GWAS Central and simulated population data (e.g. ROC curves,
          AUROCs, SNP-heritability scores) determined from careful population modelling to recreate
           individual-level GWAS data. All GWAS-ROCS data is downloadable and is intended for applications
            in genomics, biomarker discovery, and general education.

A GWAS-ROCS simulated population is a csv file with computer-generated individuals who are marked as either
 cases or controls, and given data about the presence of risk alleles (1 having the risk allele, or 0 not having
  the risk allele) at SNPs previously identified as being significant. Users can download these simulated populations
   to test their own genetic risk models, build their own simulated populations, and do much, much more!

The GWAS-ROCS Database was assembled in the hopes of accomplishing several objectives: (1) create the largest and
 most comprehensive set of SNP-derived AUROCs; (2) assist the scientific community in identifying conditions that appear
  to exhibit the best AUROC performance with multi-component SNP data; (3) identify conditions where SNP information appears
   to be relatively uninformative with regard to disease risk prediction; and (4) demonstrate the utility of using simulated
    populations to model SNP distributions and to show that these populations, along with logistic regression modelling, could
     be used to create multi-marker SNP profiles from publicly available GWAS data.

    The GWAS-ROCS Database is offered to the public as a freely available resource.
    Use and re-distribution of the data, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes
    requires explicit permission of the authors and explicit acknowledgment of the source
    material (GWAS-ROCS Database) and the original publication (see below). We ask that
    users who download significant portions of the database cite the following paper in
    any resulting publications.
