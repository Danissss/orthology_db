    Introducing Reductive Dehalogenase DB Version 1.0
  </h3>
  <p id = "abouttext">
    The Reductive Dehalogenases Database is a freely available electronic database containing the largest
      and most comprehensive set of amino acid sequence and nucletide sequence of reductive dehalogenase enzymes. Organohalide respiring bacteria (OHRB) are the organisms that produce reductive dehalogenase enzymes (RDases or RdhA if uncharacterized) for catalyzing dechlorination. 
      The database currently houses 610 sequences of reductive dehalogenase enzymes. All the enzymes are classified into 84 groups based on the similarity of their sequences (>90% identity). The database includes most studied organohalide respiring bacteria such as: Dehalococcoides mccartyi, Dehalobacter WL, Desulfitobacterium sp., Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, etc. Reductive Dehalogenases Database also includes the information about interactive substrate and inhibitor for each related enzymes. All Reductive Dehalogenases Database data is downloadable and is intended for applications in genomics, ligand-enzyme interaction discovery, and general education.
