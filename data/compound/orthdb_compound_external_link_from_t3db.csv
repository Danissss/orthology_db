","Vinyl chloride poisoning exhibits many of the characteristics of autoimmune diseases. This is believed to be the result of a reactive vinyl chloride intermediate metabolite binding to an immunoglobulin, altering the protein and initiating an immune response. The metabolites of vinyl chloride, especially choloroethylene oxide, are mutagenic and act by covalently binding to DNA. This produces cyclic etheno-adducts, which cause base-pair transitions during transcription and DNA crosslinks. Metabolites also may cause oxidative stress and affecting tumor supressor genes, as vinyl chloride has been known to produce specific mutations in the p53 and Ki-ras genes. Vinyl chloride metabolites are also believed to exert toxic effects in the liver by covalently binding to liver proteins, resulting in cellular toxicity. (L3, A65)","Vinyl chloride absorbed primarily via inhalation or ingestion is rapidly distributed throughout the body. It is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases, first into chloroethylene oxide, then into chloroacetaldehyde, which are the main toxic metabolites. Chloroacetaldehyde is further converted into chloroethanol and monochloroacetic acid. Detoxification occurs in conjunction with glutathione, producing mainly thiodiglycolic acid, which is excreted in the urine. At high doses vinyl chloride may also be excreted by exhalation.

17,T3D0016,Trichloroethylene,"Trichloroethylene is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, [t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen. The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Trichloroethylene has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of TCE Releases to Ground is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE released here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.Trichloroethylene: Parkinsonism and complex 1 mitochondrial neurotoxicity). Trichloroethylene is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials.Trichloroethylene belongs to the family of Organochlorides.

(A50, A51)","The toxic and carcinogenic effects of trichloroethylene are believed to be caused mainly by its metabolites, including trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and chloral hydrate. The nephrotoxicity and nephrocarcinogenicity of TRI have been attributed to glutathione conjunction, which forms reactive, sulfur-containing metabolites. Dichloroacetic acid is known to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, while chloral hydrate inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase. Studies in rodents have shown that neurotoxic effects may be caused by trichloroethylene's incorporation into brain membranes or ability to alter the fatty acid pattern of brain phospholipids and amino acids. One of the mechanisms of trichloroethylene's carcinogenicity is believed to be the peroxisome proliferation induced by its metabolites. (L14, T12, A46)","Trichloroethylene is absorbed into the bloodstream and rapidly distributed throughout the body.

34,T3D0033,Tetrachloroethylene,"Tetrachloroethylene, also known under the systematic name tetrachloroethene, or perchloroethylene ('perc'), and many other names, is a chlorocarbon with the formula Cl2C=CCl2. It is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics, hence it is sometimes called 'dry-cleaning fluid.' It has a sweet odor detectable by most people at a concentration of 1 part per million (1 ppm). Worldwide production was about one million metric tons in 1985. Animal studies and a study of 99 twins by Dr. Samuel Goldman and researchers at the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, California determined there is a 'lot of circumstantial evidence' that exposure to tetrachloroethene increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease ninefold. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified tetrachloroethene as a Group 2A carcinogen, which means that it is probably carcinogenic to humans.

Reactive metabolites of 1,2-dichloroethane produced by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 can bind to cellular proteins and DNA. It has been suggested that 1,2-dichloroethane-induced toxicity occurs when the biotransformation processes are saturated, thereby allowing higher levels of 1,2-dichloroethane to circulate throughout the body and conjugate with glutathione instead of being detoxified and eliminated.

The primary route of biotransformation involves conjugation with glutathione to yield nonvolatile urinary metabolites. The other route, a cytocrome P-450-mediated oxidation is responsible for the formation of chloroacetaldehyde. Metabolic saturation appears to occur sooner after oral (gavage) administration than after inhalation exposure.
