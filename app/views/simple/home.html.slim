  p#abouttext
    | The Reductive Dehalogenases Database is a freely available electronic database containing the
    | largest and most comprehensive set of amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence of reductive
    | dehalogenase enzymes. Â In 2013, Hug et al. (LINK TO PAPER) developed an ortholog-based
    | classification system for reductive dehalogenases by defining orthologous groups (OG), in order
    | to integrate new sequencing data and unify the terminology used, especially for reductive
    | dehalogenases whose functions are unknown.
    br/
    | The Reductive Dehalogenases Database is a tool to help the analysis and facilitate OG-
    | classification of new reductive dehalogenases.
